Password Generator:
This Python script generates secure passwords with a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The generator ensures that each password meets common security standards by including at least one character from each category.
Features
Customizable Length
The password generator allows you to specify the length of the password according to your needs. While the minimum length is set to 4 characters to ensure that all required character types are included, you can generate passwords of any length beyond that. This flexibility ensures that you can create passwords that meet varying security requirements or fit specific application needs.

Character Diversity
The generator guarantees that each password includes a diverse set of characters, enhancing security and complexity:

Uppercase Letters: Includes A-Z to ensure the password contains capital letters, which are commonly required for password strength.
Lowercase Letters: Includes a-z to provide a mix of small letters, contributing to overall complexity.
Special Characters: Incorporates a range of special symbols such as !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, which are crucial for meeting common password policies and enhancing entropy.
Numbers: Integrates digits from 0-9, adding another layer of variability to the generated password.
Randomized Output
To avoid predictable patterns and improve security, the password generator uses a randomization process:

Initial Selection: Starts by ensuring the inclusion of at least one character from each category (uppercase, lowercase, special characters, numbers).
Random Filling: Completes the password with additional characters selected randomly from the entire set of possible characters.
Shuffling: Applies a final shuffling step to mix the characters thoroughly. This prevents the predictability of character placement, ensuring that the final password is both random and secure.
